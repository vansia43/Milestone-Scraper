# Milestone-Scraper
# Overview
The GitHub API offers a number of ways to extract data from issue lists and other endpoints. If you want to download issues and pull requests (PRs) that are added to a repository's milestone, however, you can use this module to create a list of issues and PRs that are associated with the milestone. The Milestone Scraper parses the raw HTML to create a list of issues and PRs ID, link, and title. This information can be helpful when developing reports or release notes, outside of GitHub.
# Prerequisites
Before using the Milestone Scraper, ensure that you have the following prerequisites downloaded and installed:
- **Beautiful Soup**: Beautiful Soup is a Python library that works along with a parser to pull data from HTML and XML libraries. See the [Beautiful Soup Installation Documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup) for information on how to install the library.
- **An HTML parser**: You can use any HTML parser along with Beautiful Soup to parse the downloaded HTML. Python 3 has a [built-in HTML parser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html).
